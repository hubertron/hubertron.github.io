[Vellum by the NY Times](http://vellum.nytlabs.com/)
<p>The NY Times developed an app that scrapes twitter for links that people in your news feed post. It's a great, new way of digesting twitter content quickly and easily. I have known about it for 2 days and its already part of my life. </p>
<br />

[Moby and Miley Cyrus](http://www.stereogum.com/1690824/wayne-coyne-miley-cyrus-did-all-the-drugs-and-made-this-nsfw-movie-with-moby/video/)
<p>A really really really weird video made by Moby and Miley Cyrus. I couldn't even get through it. Serious WTF factor.</p>
<br />

[Bread and Butter Pron](http://foodcurated.com/2014/07/the-jiro-dreams-of-sushi-of-bread-butter-razza-pizza-artiginale/)
<p>If you love bread as much as me then its time you met Dan Richer. The "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" of bread and butter. Produced by the amazing filmmaker Liza de Guia.<p>
<br />

[Shaz Creative](http://shazcreative.com/)
<p>A personal site of my friend Shaz. Shows of some of his work and tells the Internet his story. Cool stuff</p>
<br />

<p>Great sound from NYC based producer Proper Villains.
