[Weird Al - Tacky](http://www.nerdist.com/vepisode/weird-al-yankovic-gets-tacky-with-pharrells-happy/)
<p>Weird Al is back, with Jack Black, Kristen Schaal, and others. A "Happy" parody. Worth clicking for sure.</p>
<br />

[The Blackest Black](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/blackest-is-the-new-black-scientists-have-developed-a-material-so-dark-that-you-cant-see-it-9602504.html)
<p>Something so black now exists that the human eye can't even comprehend it. Pretty crazy. I would love to see it in person.</p>

[Everyone is Mad About Net Neutrality](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/14/5897743/google-netflix-facebook-fcc-interconnection-fees-net-neutrality)
<p>It's still in the solar system, but its also in interstellar space. NASA makes everyone happy based on the data and its truly exciting.<p>
<br />

[A New Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-raspberry-pi-model-b-plus/)
<p>A Raspberry Pi B+ just came out. It's a bit better than the original. It's not worlds better then the current B, but for the same price a small improvements is nice.</p>
<br />

[A Day in the Life of a NYC Taxi](http://nyctaxi.herokuapp.com/)
<p>Really fun little visualization of a Taxi across a single day. It's amazing how short of a trip people take and how little the driver really does make.</p>
